# üìä Project Phase 3 ‚Äî Data Systems (Spring 2025)

**Due Date:** 11:59 PM, Friday, 18th April 2025  

---

## üìå Instructions

- This is a **team project** ‚Äî you‚Äôll work in the teams assigned previously.
- Build upon your code-base from earlier phases.
- All commits must be pushed to the **`master` branch** of your GitHub Classroom repository.
  - You may work on separate branches but **merge them into master before the due date**.
- No personal queries will be entertained. Please post all questions on **Moodle**.
- If any commit is made past the deadline, fill out a **Late Day Form** on the day of submission and mention the correct date of your last commit.
- Not following these instructions will result in a penalty.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Commands & Functionality

This phase focuses on implementing **Indexing structures** and integrating them into SQL query operations.

- Choose any suitable indexing structure but provide a justification for your choice in the final report.
- You‚Äôll be graded on both **correctness** and **efficiency**.
- Assume test cases will use large tables **exceeding main memory capacity**.
  - Maximum memory allowance: **10 blocks at any time**.
- **Submissions without indexing** will receive **zero marks**.
- Supported operators for conditions:
  ```
  <, <=, >, >=, ==, !=
  ```
- Conditions are in the format:
  ```
  col_name bin_op value
  ```

## üìñ Command Specifications

### üîç 2.1 SEARCH

**Syntax:**
```sql
res_table <- SEARCH FROM table_name WHERE condition
```

**Example:**
**Table:** `Students`

| Stud_ID | phy | chem | math |
|:--------|:-----|:------|:------|
| 1 | 36 | 41 | 29 |
| 2 | 49 | 49 | 20 |
| 3 | 37 | 43 | 49 |
| 4 | 47 | 44 | 50 |
| 5 | 17 | 21 | 9 |
| 6 | 10 | 27 | 26 |
| 7 | 40 | 6 | 9 |

**Query:**
```sql
exampleResult <- SEARCH FROM Students WHERE math >= 30
```

**Result:**
| Stud_ID | phy | chem | math |
|:--------|:-----|:------|:------|
| 3 | 37 | 43 | 49 |
| 4 | 47 | 44 | 50 |

**Notes:**
- `SEARCH` works like the existing `SELECT` but uses **Indexing** for optimization.
- Do **not modify** the existing `SELECT` implementation in `SimpleRA`.
- Implement a **new SEARCH command** leveraging Indexing.
